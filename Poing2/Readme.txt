BASeCamp BASeBlock
-------------------

BASeBlock is what can best be called Yet another Arkanoid clone. Many of it's features and gameplay elements are not particularly unique; others are. I don't know, I just sort of added 
stuff I thought would be cool.

Installation
------------

The BASeBlock Installation Program should install all necessary files in their appropriate locations.



When you start BASeBlock, it (for some reason) takes a few seconds on some computers to show the splash screen (I think this is the CLR starting up? no idea) Once it does, the textbox
at the bottom of that splash screen will show the current operation. For most people this is trivial and useless information, but if you have problems that information could prove useful to me to
try to track down your issue, so I've added a helpful "Copy" button once the initialization is complete.
